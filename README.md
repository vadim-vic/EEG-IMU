# EEG-IMU spatial time series for behavioral analysis 
## Abstract 
This project collects tools for forecasting models of multimodal spatial times series. A common timeline joins 
1. EEG (channels, time)
2. IMU accelerometer and gyroscope ([ax, ay, az, x, y ,z], time)
3. Pulse wave, breathe wave ([p,b], time)
   
These time series are originated from a person's measurements during a session. Assume a session lasts 10 minutes to one hour. There might be several sessions of one participant. A group of participants might be observed.
## Progress
1. April Introduction to Sugihara's CCM
2. April Models of time series analysis
3. April Long-term monitoring of physical workers
4. May The pipeline of EEG-IMU processing
5. May Quasi-supervised learning and health monitoring
