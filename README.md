# EEG-IMU spatial time series for behavioral analysis 

This project collects tools for forecasinf models of multomodal spatial times series. A common timeline joins 
1. EEG (time, channels)
2. IMU acceleration and gyroscope ([ax, ay, az, x, y ,z], time)
3. Pulse wave, beathe wave
This time series are originated from a person's measurements during a sesion. Assume a session lasts 10 minutes to one hour. There might be several sessions of one participants. A group of participants might be observed.
